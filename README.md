# Car-evaluation-dataset-data-mining
The Car evaluation dataset is a ready-made dataset from the UCI dataset repository. In this dataset, cars have certain characteristics. Car evaluation dataset analysis was performed on the RapidMiner Studio platform. Since the received data does not contain incomplete and noisy data, Data cleaning is not done. In order to get a better performance in the data set, transformation and normalization were made from the data preprocessing steps. Then, three classifier models of the classification method were used in the data set. These are: decision tree, k-nn and naive bayes. These three methods were applied on the data set and their performances were determined and compared.
